The students and faculties of GSC, located on the Sagamihara Campus, are ready to support international students. You can also meet English-speaking staff at the Student Center. So if you need help, please stop by. You will find GSC’s major support resources for international students at the center, which should help you get off to a smooth start for your life in Japan.

## Support
###  Advisers, Buddy/Tutor System
International students are assigned a faculty adviser and a student buddy/tutor. Buddies/tutors can help the students with course registration, adjusting to life in Japan, Japanese-speaking practice, etc. The Japanese students who volunteer for the buddy system are very interested in other cultures and in developing international friendships.

### Airport Pick-Up Service
This is a shuttle bus service available at Narita Airport provided by GSC for international students moving into accommodation near the Sagamihara Campus. The bus leaves the airport and goes directly to the campus. Please note, however, you might need to wait for several hours depending on the time your flight is arriving.

### Orientations for International Students
Several orientations are scheduled either before or during the first week of each semester to provide information on such things as course registration, life in Japan and facilities on campus. Most of you will come to Japan for the first time, so all the staffs on our campus are ready to support you and answer your questions during these sessions.

## Activities
### Coffee meetings
These meetings are for international students, AGU students and buddies/tutors to socialize together, with games and events. They usually take place two or three times in a semester at the Sagamihara Campus. Don’t miss out on these fun events!

## Accommodation
We help international students find accommodation as convenient and close to our campus as possible. Below are some examples of housing we have introduced previously. Please note that they may not have availability when you apply.
