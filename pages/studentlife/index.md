## Support
###  Advisers and Tutors
International students are assigned a faculty adviser and a student tutor. Tutors(student buddies) can help the students with course registration, adjusting to life in Japan, Japanese-speaking practice, etc. The Japanese students who volunteer for the tutor program are very interested in other cultures and in developing international friendships.

### Airport Pick-Up Service
This is a shuttle bus service available at Narita Airport provided by AGU for international students moving into accommodation near the Sagamihara Campus. The bus leaves the airport and goes directly to the campus. Please note, however, you might need to wait for several hours depending on the time your flight is arriving.


## Accommodation
We help international students find accommodation as convenient and close to our campus as possible. Below are some examples of housing we have introduced previously. Please note that they may not have availability when you apply.
