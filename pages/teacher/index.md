## Aoyama Gakuin University (AGU)

Combining cutting-edge innovation with a rich tradition of teaching and education
Aoyama Gakuin University (AGU) was established in 1949. It is part of Aoyama Gakuin, an educational institute based on the Christian faith that marked its 140 year anniversary in November 2014. AGU is widely recognized as one of Japan’s leading universities, with a reputation for its quality of education and cosmopolitan ambience.

AGU has two campuses that are home to 10 schools and 24 departments, with an enrollment of over 19,000 students. The original main campus is in Aoyama, a district in the heart of Tokyo and one of the city’s most fashionable and popular areas. The Sagamihara Campus, a spacious site on the outskirts of Tokyo, was opened in 2003 to expand the university’s educational program and enhance academic achievement. This knowledge hub boasting state-of-the-art facilities is involved in joint research with prominent organizations, companies and universities from Japan and abroad.
